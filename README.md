## Introduction
SynVerse is a framework with an encoder-decoder architecture. It incorporates diverse input features and a reasonable approximation of model architectures commonly employed by existing deep learning-based synergy prediction methods. It includes four data-splitting strategies and three ablation methods: module-based, feature shuffling, and a novel network-based approach to isolate factors influencing model performance.

## Conda Environment Setup
If you haven't cloned the repository yet, run the following command to clone it and navigate to the SynVerse folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Murali-group/SynVerse.git
cd SynVerse
```

Then, follow the steps below to set up the `synverse` environment with required libraries using the provided [`synverse.yml`](./synverse.yml) file.

```bash
conda env create -f synverse.yml
```
To run the command, make sure Conda is installed. If not, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install) or the lighter version, [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install).

After the environment is created, activate it using:
```bash
conda activate synverse
```

To verify that the environment and its dependencies are set up correctly, you can list the installed packages:
```bash
conda list
```

## Download Processed Dataset
All datasets used in this study, including drug and cell line features and the preprocessed synergy dataset required to reproduce the results, are available in the [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/records/15277144). Download and unzip the `inputs.zip` file, and place the `inputs` folder in the project directory, at the same level as the `code/` folder.


## How to Use SynVerse

SynVerse is configured using a YAML file (e.g., [sample_config.yaml](https://github.com/Murali-group/SynVerse/blob/main/code/config_files/sample_config.yaml)), which allows users to define the input features, model architecture, and evaluation strategies. Once a configuration file is prepared, SynVerse can be run in various modes to perform different tasks:

1. To train and test a model:
```
   python main.py --config_file config_files/sample_config.yaml --train_type 'regular'
```
2. To perform feature-shuffling-based ablation study:
```
   python main.py --config_file config_files/sample_config.yaml --train_type 'shuffle'
```
3. To perform network-based ablation study:
```
   python main.py --config_file config_files/sample_config.yaml --train_type 'rewire'
```
