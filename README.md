# SynVerse
SynVerse is a framework with an encoder-decoder architecture. It incorporates diverse input features and a reasonable approximation of model architectures commonly employed by existing deep learning-based synergy prediction methods. It includes four data-splitting strategies and three ablation methods: module-based, feature shuffling, and a novel network-based approach to isolate factors influencing model performance.
